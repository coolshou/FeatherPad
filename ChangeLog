V0.9.1
---------
 * Two more symbolic icons.
 * Avoid conversion from "const char*" to "ushort".
 * Set the window title to the whole path, including the file name.
 * Instant tooltips for the side-pane.
 * Workaround for a Qt bug, because of which, "FullWidthSelection" isn't respected when line ends are shown.
 * Scroll the view when the mouse wheel is turned on the line number strip.
 * Center the current line on double clicking the line number strip.
 * Allow customizing tab switch shortcuts.
 * Show a warning if the size limit for syntax highlighting is exceeded.
 * Disable the language button when there is no highlighter.
 * Disable syntax highlighting on printing (because the whole document may not be highlighted).

V0.9.0
---------
 * Changed versioning -- "0.9.0" instead of "0.9", for example.
 * Added an option for the text tab size in terms of spaces.
 * Added "To Upper Case" and "To Lower Case".
 * Always fall back to the URL highlighter (forget the previous conditions). In this way, not only the behavior is more logical but also the code is much simpler.
 * Disable the language button for documents that are made uneditable because of their contents.
 * Open the files of the last window instead of starting with all recent files (if the related option is checked).
 * Restore cursor positions with last window files too.
 * Remove the lock file only at the end, when the config is written, because writing may take some time with cursor positions.
 * Remember the splitter position also when the side-pane is removed.
 * Before focusing an existing side-pane with its toggling shortcut, ensure its visibility.
 * Added the overwrite mode, which is toggled by pressing the Insert key.
 * Added an option for saving unmodified files.
 * Added an option for closing a window on closing its last tab.
 * Fixed a regression in recognizing special files (started when QRegExp was replaced by QRegularExpression).
 * Added Ctrl+Up/Down for scrolling by one line without moving the cursor.
 * Added Meta+Up/Down for going to the same position in the previous/next unwrapped line.
 * Added shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down) for moving lines.
 * Added a history popup to the search bar.
 * Set the window title to the path.
 * Also open paths that point to nonexistent files (to save them later).
 * Don't show the warning bar when there's a modal dialog.
 * Added command-line options for cursor position.
 * Deal with relative paths completely.
 * Added an option to not permit opening of non-text files.
 * Added the number of pages to tab/side-item context menu.
 * Made Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Meta+Tab and Shift+Tab really align the text.
 * Covered regex inside QML too (with syntax highlighting).
 * Never remove trailing spaces with diff files.
 * Made highlighting of JavaScript regex faster and fixed some bugs in it.
 * Added an option for thick text cursor.
 * Made the current line number bold and added a marker for wrapped lines. Also made the line highlighter much milder.
 * Center the current line on clicking inside the line number strip.
 * Toggle side-pane by middle clicking an empty space inside it or inside the tab-bar.
 * Put the line number strip on the right with an RTL layout.

V0.8
---------
 * Close the warning-bar when the text is scrolled.
 * Fixed the workaround for the RTL bug in QPlainTextEdit (it included an odd line and the indentation lines were disabled for RTL).
 * Some fixes for markdown and sh syntax highlighting.
 * Fixed highlighting of here-docs for languages other than sh.
 * Fixed highlighting of bash command substitution by using a completely different approach with a simple logic.
 * Added the symlink "fpad".
 * Added an options for auto-saving of opened files (disabled by default).
 * Fixed a potential cause of crash in the function "formatOnTextChange()" by using the object "this" in the singleShot timer.
 * Close tabs on releasing the middle mouse button instead of pressing it.
 * Add a new tab on double clicking an empty space of the tabbar.
 * Added a warning about the lack of permission to read.
 * Show warnings on focusing the window or changing the tab when a file is modified in another way or removed.
 * An option for showing the cursor position on the statusbar (disabled by default).
 * Support syntax override (disabled by default).
 * An option for vertical position lines.
 * Don't Activate the window repeatedly on opening multiple files because, otherwise, the input might be blocked.
 * Fixed a mistake in localization that didn't let Simplified Chinese be detected.
 * Added a configurable date and time pasting.
 * Open hyperlinks of highlighted texts by left-clikcing them while the Ctrl key is pressed and also with an item in the context menu.
 * Put the cursor at the right-click position if it has no selection.
 * Replaced QRegExp with QRegularExpression.
 * Added an option for removing trailing spaces on saving (Markdown's trailing double spaces are taken care of).
 * Added Undo/Redo to custom shortcuts, although their default shortcuts are hard-coded in Qt.
 * Don't show the shortcut strings of the editor context menu because they can be misleading.
 * Fixed an old bug in font setting when the document was zoomed.
 * Show whitespaces or line/document ends with normal texts too (by using the URL syntax highlighting).
 * Never show the horizontal scrollbar on wrapping (when whitespaces are visible).
 * Instead of QSharedMemory, use a lock file to create a single instance application because QSharedMemory not only is unsafe in case a crash happens (catching a crash is not an option) but also may persist without a crash and even after being attached and detached, resulting in an unchangeable state. Also, for whatever reason, QSharedMemory may cause random delays.
 * Never use QCoreApplication::processEvents() because the waiting object may be deleted meanwhile.
 * Support scss (without syntax error but with its keywords).
 * Added translators' names/links to About dialog. Also added the license info.
 * Handle "&quot;", "&gt;" and "&lt;", especially in XML.
 * Support hard-coded symbolic icons that change their colors appropriately (adapted from Cantata).
 * Don't let QPlainTextEdit's built-in undo/redo shortcuts cause a scroll jump when there's nothing to do (such scroll jumps are a Qt bug, in my opinion).

V0.7
---------
 * Remember cursor positions for files that are managed by the session dialog (thanks to AcarBurak at GitHub for the idea).
 * Side-pane mode with filtering.
 * French translation by Cyril Cottet.
 * Also apply all settings when Escape is pressed to close the Preferences dialog. (Some settings were applied only when the Close button was pressed).
 * Added an option to save a session only from the currect window.
 * An option for always opening files in separate windows.
 * Fixed a memory leak in making the cursor busy on closing a window with a tab (found by valgrind).
 * Fixed a bug in bracket matching, which happened when a selected text was removed while the cursor was at its start.
 * Get red of "foreach" because it is deprecated and will be removed sooner or later.
 * Fixed double connections with syntax highlighting of dropped pages.
 * Don't set the right-clicked side-pane item as the current item.
 * Added items for closing next/previous tabs to side-pane context menus.
 * Fixed incomplete syntax highlighting after the active tab is changed quickly several times.
 * Distinguish opened symlinks visually. Also, add context menu items for copying their target paths and opening their targets.
 * When checking if a file is already opened, also consider symlink targets.
 * Syntax highlighting for regular expressions of JavaScript (/.../).
 * Fixes for the syntax highlighting of HTML, especially its style and embedded JavaScript.
 * Reduced the maximum file size to 100 MiB.
 * Truncate all lines with more than 500,000 characters while loading a text because they would take a lot of CPU time if shown. Append this string to the truncated lines: "    HUGE LINE TRUNCATED: NO LINE WITH MORE THAN 500000 CHARACTERS". Also, don't highlight the syntax of documents with such lines.
 * Don't format huge lines (with more than 50,000 characters) in CSS. This is especially useful with HTML syntax highlighting. (Kate avoids this problem by "jumping" over huge lines while scrolling but that isn't a good solution, in my opinion.)
 * Open non-text files as well as files with huge lines as completely uneditable documents to prevent accidental overwritings.
 * A workaround for a Qt5 bug that will cause a crash if "QPlainTextEdit::setTextCursor()" comes before "QTextCursor::endEditBlock()", near the end of a very long line. Similar bugs were reported but, apparently, there is a buggy code at the root of all Qt5 crashes related to "QPlainTextEdit::setTextCursor()".

V0.6.3
---------
 * Optional inertial wheel scrolling when the cursor is inside the text view.
 * Use the native font dialog as a workaround under GTK environments.

V0.6.2
---------

 * Fixed single-line comments when the comment sign is repeated after being quoted.
 * Fixed two bad typos in "session.cpp".

V0.6.1
---------

 * Multiple-line indentation with Tab and de-indentation BackTab (Shift+Tab).
 * Ctrl+Tab for a 4-space tabulation and Ctrl+Meta+Tab for a 2-space one.
 * Middle-click closes the tab.
 * Don't open files > 500 MiB.
 * Added a warning-bar for non-prompt messages.
 * Added markdown to syntax highlighting (thanks to AcarBurak at GitHub).
 * Highlight the syntax of sh double quoted code substitution variables "$(...)".
 * Russian translation by Vladimir Sharonin (Survolog at GitHub).
 * Polish translation by Marcin Miko≈Çajczak (m4sk1n at GitHub).
 * Danish translation by scootergrisen at GitHub.
 * Made translation support optional.
 * Warn the user about a previous crash.
 * Added an option for native file dialogs.
 * Restore the scrollbar position, in addition to the cursor, on reloading.
 * Consider "next-line" comments (with an ending back-slash) in c/c++.
 * Workaround for "the hover bug" in Qt5 (will it ever be fixed?!).
 * Highlight the syntax on text change too (because otherwise, the text won't be formatted if the whole visible text is pasted).
 * Auto-bracket support.
 * A workaround for the RTL bug in QPlainTextEdit.
 * A workaround for the scrollbar range bug in QPlainTextEdit (the range wasn't updated correctly on chaanging font size).
 * Don't let the statusbar text change the window width.
 * Added options for showing whitespaces and line/document ends with syntax highlighting.
 * Match brackets too (in addition to parentheses and braces).
 * Added config files to syntax highlighting.
 * Support Shift+Enter (useful e.g. to write code comments).
 * Addded a shortcut editor to Preferences for customizing some shortcuts.
 * Filtering for the session manager dialog.

V0.6.0
---------
 * FeatherPad deserves a new version.
 * Made the number of the "Recently Modified" menu items optional.
 * Give each tab a separate search bar to preserve search undo/redo history on switching tabs and also to have completely independent searches.
 * Removed the remainder of the old C structure of the code.
 * Change the title of the Replacement dock appropriately on tab switching.
 * Workarounds for some KDE bugs (automatic mnemonics and double slashes).

 * Added a prompt label to the Preferences dialog.
 * Support Perls's POD (in syntax highlighting).
 * Session management.
 * Set the maximum tab length to half the tabbar size and elide tab text dynamically.
 * Always ensure enough contrast between the active/inactive text selection color and the line highlight color.
 * Added an option that, by default, will append an empty line on saving if the last line of the document isn't empty.

V0.5.9
---------
 * Added support for FreeBSD.
 * Added support for text zooming with Ctrl+wheel.
 * Added an option for the tab navigation with keyboard to wrap around.

 * Support for opening files with newline in their names.
 * Support for hiding menubar.
 * Added a lot of CMake and Python keywords to syntax highlighting.
 * A workaround for Qt's backward search bug.

V0.5.8
---------
 * The here-doc delimiter shouldn't be commented out.
 * Format note and url patterns inside Python multiline quotes.
 * When reformatting single-line comments inside Highlighter::multiLineComment(), consider note and url patterns too.
 * Added a separate option for working around the translucency bug of Qt-5.7.
 * When highlighting the syntax, do the main (single-line) formatting only in the visible part of the text. In this way, syntax highlighting becomes very fast for most languages.
 * A very simple logic for syntax highlighting of here-docs.
 * Remove search (and replacement) highlights on hiding the search bar.
 * Always show the search bar on showing the replacement dock. Also hide the latter on hiding the former.
 * Added an option for using dark color scheme.
 * An option to set a fixed start size (700x500 is still the default size).
 * Added an option for tab position.
 * Elide long tab texts.
 * Added two items to tab context menu for copying file name and path.
 * Made tab drag-and-drop independent from X11.
 * Fixed an old bug in opening multiple files (it was created after using threads).
 * Support selection of multiple files in the open file dialog.
 * Added a time buffer for the currentChanged() signal of QTabWidget.
 * Made all dialogs window-modal without letting two dialogs at the same time (as a workaround for a Qt issue).
 * Set the cursor to busy after one second of unfinished activity.
 * Explicitly disable all window shortcuts when a dialog is shown (Qt should disable all shortcuts of the main window when a modal dialog is shown. This is a Qt bug).
 * While files are being loaded, disable dangerous shortcuts and don't let any dialog be shown.
 * Added tab switch menu-items (and shortcuts).

V0.5.7
---------
 * Added libqt5svg5 as a dependency to 'INSTALL' (but it isn't a build dependency).
 * Added an option for choosing between own and system icons.
 * Fixed a memory leak which was created when QtSingleApplication was removed.

V0.5.6
---------
 * Because of a Qt5 bug, an app may crash on logging out (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-50829). As a workaround, replaced all theme icons with own icons.
 * Added RDF, QML, docbook and xhtml to syntax highlighting.
 * Enable C++11.
 * Get unix quit signals, namely SIGQUIT, SIGINT (Ctrl-C), SIGTERM and SIGHUP (terminal closed).
 * When deciding to open a new window or tab, also consider the current viewport in addition to the current desktop. For example, Compiz has only one desktop, which may be divided into multiple viewports.
 * Explicitly call updateGeometry() for the text-edit on layout change if the main window is translucent. (Workaround for a regression in Qt-5.7?)

V0.5.5
---------
 * Use a separate thread to get text. (Maybe useful later.)
 * Set size limit for syntax highlighting.
 * Put the source on GitHub.
 * Added QtGlobal types and functions to syntax highlighting.

V0.5.4
---------
 * Code clean-up.
 * Replaced the C++-only methods for validating UTF-8 with QTextCodec::toUnicode().
 * Added HDPI support.
 * Transformed signal-slot connections into the new syntax.

V0.5.3
---------
 * Reversed the change that was made for bypassing the old KGlobal-locale warning message.
 * Implemented auto-scrolling to selected file in file dialogs.
 * Replaced search push-buttons with tool-buttons.

V0.5.2
---------
 * At last, found a simple workaround for Qt5's scroll jump bug.
 * Use singleShot instead of processEvents.
 * Never use native dialogs (since KFileDialog can't be trusted).
 * Removed a ridiculous cause of crash from closeEvent().
 * Fixed an old bug in auto-indentation.

V0.5.1
---------
 * Removed own icons.
 * No context menu outside all tabs.

V0.5.0
---------
 * Exported to Qt5 because Qt 5.4.2 seems OK.
 * Workaround for a Qt5 bug, which prevents insertion of the non-breaking space (zero-width non-joiner, ZWNJ) with SHIFT+SPACE.

V0.4.9
---------
 * Replaced "%U" with "%F" in the desktop file and used toLocalFile() if the file path is a URL.
 * In log files, the day number may only have one digit.

V0.4.8
---------
 * Use QSharedMemory, QLocalServer and QLocalSocket instead of QtSingleApplication to have a single-instance app with a simpler code.
 * Instead of adding a member variable to the window class, use the qApp macro to get the app.
 * Set window modality for the subdialogs of the print dialog too.
 * Don't open new tabs in minimized windows; respect the minimized state!
 * Use X11 functions for detecting the shaded state and unshading again because isMinimized() may not return true for shaded windows under all WMs.
 * Format urls and email addresses inside single-line comments too.
 * Format special notes inside comments.
 * Format qmake paths.
 * Some languages need backslash as the line ending for multiline quotes.
 * Remove server instance from previous crash.
 * Use documentMode.

V0.4.7
---------
 * Take into account some DEs that don't support _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP.
 * Always use absoluteFilePath() when opening a file.
 * Use absolutePath() instead of dir().path() to show the path of the opened file as tooltip.
 * Do nothing in keyPressEvent() if the text is readonly.
 * Guarantee a fixed height for lineedits.
 * Instead of hiding and showing a window to resize it to the default size, reparent it with a dummy widget and take it out again to guarantee resizing under all DEs.

V0.4.6
---------
 * Faster mouse wheel scrolling when the mouse cursor is on the vertical scrollbar.
 * Use changeEvent() to get the window state because not all window managers trigger resizeEvent() when a window is unmaximized.
 * Rehighlight found matches after zooming out or changing font.
 * For returning to the default size to be possible under all circumstances, hide the window before resizing and show it again afterward.

V0.4.5
---------
 * Added syntax highlighting for HTML embedded JavaScript.
 * Added syntax highlighting for extra bash keywords.
 * Added syntax highlighting for srt subtitles and gtkrc.
 * A workaround for the scrollbar range(s) not being updated after zooming in the text.
 * To unshade the active window, it's enough to consider it minimized and then, restore and activate it.

V0.4.4
---------
 * Added HTML multiline comment highlighting.

V0.4.2
---------
 * Added '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libX11.so' as a system library to the project to fix the new error messages "x11.o: undefined reference to symbol...".
 * Corrected highlighting of Bash keywords and also url patterns.
 * Show tab tooltips without delay.
 * Don't use setFixedSize() with dialogs because it may prevent them from being centered when shown.
 * Under KDE, when text is selected for the first time after starting FeatherPad, it isn't copied to the selection clipboard. Although I still don't know the cause (Klipper?), I found a workaround.

V0.4.1
--------
 * Added tab context menus for closing other tabs.
 * When text is selected, use the left and right arrow keys to go to the start and end of the selection respectively.

 * When an empty file is opened in the current tab, open the next file in a new tab.

V0.4.0
--------
 * Made FeatherPad independent from any icon set.
 * Use an extra setTextCursor() in find() for the signal selectionChanged() be emitted (it's needed by the status bar).
 * Set the toolbar icon size explicitly to 22x22.
 * Made the status bar info selectable with mouse.
 * More complete email address pattern in quotation highlighting.
 * Fixed bugs in searching for multiline strings.

V0.3.6
--------
 * When highlighting found matches, search for them only inside the visible part of the text.

 * Fixed some bugs related to quotation and commenting out.
 * Don't disconnect the syntax highlighting signal in a QTextDocument when doing tab DND.

V0.3.4
--------
 * A more advanced way of CSS syntax highlighting (with error handling).

V0.3.3
--------
 * Fixed the CSS syntax highlighting.

V0.3.2
--------
 * Rehighlight found matches after text replacement because they may need correction.
 * Set style sheet only for the viewport of QPlainTextEdit.
 * Added icons for GTK+ based environments and also for root.
 * Always use raise() after activateWindow().
 * Corrected a mistake, which had occurred during replacement of QLists with QHash.

V0.3.1
--------
 * Corrected the C single-line comment.
 * When opening a file, use the name of the currently opened file in the dialog.
 * When saving a deleted file, show the save-as dialog only if the file isn't restorable (because its containing folder is removed).
 * Disconnect everything connected to the signal modificationChanged() before setting text and reconnect them afterward.

V0.3.0
--------
 * Use QHash instead of QLists to set and get the needed info on each tab.
 * After a disastrous overwriting, I decided to use filters for saving as far as possible.

V0.2.10
--------
 * Added an option to Preferences for always showing the statusbar.
 * Format Apt's sources.list.
 * Removed duplicate QActions.

V0.2.9
--------
 * Yet faster highlighting of here-docs.
 * Don't reset the chosen encoding of a new document to UTF-8 with tab switching.
 * Offer saving before changing the encoding if the text of an opened file is modified.

V0.2.8
--------
 * Better and faster highlighting of here-docs.
 * To be able to open system files as well, use read() instead of getChar() for file opening.

V0.2.7
--------
 * It seems that highlighting of here-docs works now, although not efficiently.

V0.2.6
--------
 * A slightly better way for highlighting of here-documents.
 * Cleaned up the detection of escaped quotes.
 * Use link target to get mime type.

V0.2.5
--------
 * TextBlockData needed a destructor.
 * Syntax highlighting for Perl.
 * Only an odd number of backslashes before a quotation mark means that it's escaped.

V0.2.4
---------
 * Added parentheses and braces matching.

V0.2.3
---------
 * Suppose that only the script languages (Bash, Lua and Python) have both single and double quotes.

V0.2.2
---------
 * Added formatting of Bash "here documnents".

V0.2.1
---------
 * Debugged and polished syntax highlighting.

V0.2.0
---------
 * Dropped using of source-highlight-qt and source-highlight; devised a heuristic method instead.

V0.1.11
---------
 * Included what was needed from source-highlight-qt in the source.
 * Show the number of replaced occurrences.

V0.1.10
---------
 * Fixed bugs in text highlighting.

V0.1.9
---------
 * If a tab with a readonly text is dropped, don't activate cut and delete menuitems.
 * No need to set the visibility of actionEdit when dropping tabs as it's set by tabChange().
 * The tab detachment keyboard shortcut was ambiguous.
 * Set the tab width proportional to the font size.
 * Added 'About' dialog and 'Help'.
 * Use path of containing folder as tab tootip and insert ellipsis for very long tooltips.
 * Fixed a silly bug in tab DND.
 * Write size to the config file only if necessary.
 * Fixed a little bug in size preference.
 * Enabled tooltips for inactive windows.

V0.1.8
---------
 * A better way of giving window modality to open and save dialogs, which bypasses the KDE bug related to the KGlobal-locale warning message.
 * No need to delete child widgets as they're deleted with their parents.

 * Fixed two bugs related to the clear shortcut and the clear button of LineEdit.

V0.1.5
---------
 * Added calculation of word numbers to the status bar.
 * It's more logical to keep a tab with empty document when another tab is dropped into its window.
 * Fixed a bug related to the enabled/disabled states of the reload button and menu item.

V0.1.4
---------
 * Simplified an X11 function (no need to get a list of all windows in the order of creation).
 * Always use QX11Info::display() instead of XOpenDisplay(NULL), otherwise there would be a memory leak.

V0.1.3
---------
 * Use closeTab() in detachTab().
 * Prevent any possibility of memory leak by using appropriate destructors and returning QList instead of "Window*" from the X11 function List().
 * Don't drop tab if the drop target has a modal dialog.
 * Open a window and not a tab if a FeatherPad window is on the same desktop but has a modal dialog.

V0.1.2
---------
 * Drop a dragged tab into the topmost FeatherPad window if the drop point is inside more than one window.
 * Don't add a new tab if the current tab of the drop target has no text and isn't modified.
 * Fixed a memory leak in the function whichDesktops().

V0.1.1
---------
 * Tab drag-and-drop, including tab detachment and window merging, without using of Qt's DnD mechanism.
 * Fixed disappearance of green highlights when the yellow ones were repainted.
 * Better X11 functions.
 * Use window modality and not application modality for all dialogs.
 * Other minor fixes.
